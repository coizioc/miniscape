If you are new to the game, welcome! Below is a list of the most important commands you need to know to start out:

In addition, here are some of the main activities you can partake in:

* `~kill [number] [monster] [length: minutes]` kills either a given number of monsters, or kills or a monster for a set period of time for combat experience. Example: `~kill 250 goblin` kills 250 goblins, while `kill goblin 15` kills goblins for 15 minutes.

* `~cancel` cancels whatever action you are currently doing. There may be some limitations on this command depending on which action you are currently performing.

You do not have to do all of these. You can focus on just killing goblins with your fists for all I care. Some more activities you can enjoy are listed in the **commands.md** file.
